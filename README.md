# Quady

Quady is a quad-edge implementation in C++ of the Quad-Edge data structure. The source code was adapted from the old implementation found on Paul Heckbert's [afs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/andrew/scs/cs/15-463/2001/pub/src/a2/quadedge.html).

Why? Simply because it's a fascinating data structure and the code deserves to be maintained in a state that is usable in other projects.

## Requirements

A C++-11 compliant compiler and CMake.

## Testing

This uses CTest.

## License

Released under the MIT license.

NOTE: I could not find a license for the original code on which this is based.
